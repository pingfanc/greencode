# Greencode

This dissertation project aims to optimize code using generative AI and evaluate the performance of the optimized code using the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) score. The goal is to determine whether the optimized code performs better compared to the initial code.


## Project Overview:
This project includes the following key components:

1. Generative AI for Code Optimization: Utilizing advanced generative AI techniques to improve the efficiency and performance of code.

2. Performance Evaluation: Assessing the optimized code by comparing it to the initial version using the SCI score, which measures software efficiency and carbon emissions.

3. Streamlit Web Application: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit to allow users to input their code and view the optimization results.
The application provides insights into the carbon emissions caused by the execution of the code.
